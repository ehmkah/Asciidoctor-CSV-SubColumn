To include content by column range, begin with start column end with end column and separate them with two dot (e.g., columns=1..5) to the columns attribute.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns=1..3]
```
You could have multiple ranges separate with comma. Quote the list of ranges as commas are normally to separate individual attributes.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns="1..3,10..14"]
```

You can use semi-colons to separate ranges to instead the quote and commas combination.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns=1;5..8;10..15]
```

== Example
* Original csv file

```asciidoc
[%autowidth%header, format=csv, separator=,]
|===
\include::{includedir}\FieldAgents.csv[]
|===
```
